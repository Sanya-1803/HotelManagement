    <p style="color: red;">Scope of This Policy</p><br>
        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how the Radisson Hospitality Belgium BV/SRL (“we” or “us”) collects, uses, consults or otherwise processes an individual’s Personal Data. This Privacy Policy applies globally, but depending on where you live some specific provisions of this Privacy Policy may not apply to you.<br>
        <br>
        In some of the situations described in this Privacy Policy, the hotel where you made a booking and/or stay will also process your data as a (joint or sole) Controller. The hotel will be solely responsible for the processing activities for which it is the sole Controller.<br>
        <br>
       
        We are committed to protecting the privacy of our users and customers.
        <br>
        This Privacy Policy is intended to inform you how we gather, define, and use Personal Data that you provide to us when using our websites and mobile applications or when relying on our hospitality services. Please take a moment to read this Privacy Policy carefully. Please note that if you plan to submit someone else’s Personal Data to us, for instance when making a booking on their behalf, you may only provide us with that person’s details with their consent and after they have been given access to information about how we will use their details, including the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy.<br>
        <br>
        THIS POLICY INCLUDES A DESCRIPTION OF YOUR DATA PROTECTION RIGHTS, INCLUDING A RIGHT TO OBJECT TO SOME OF THE PROCESSING ACTIVITIES WE CARRY OUT. PLEASE NOTE THAT YOUR RIGHTS AS A DATA SUBJECT MAY VARY DEPENDING UPON WHERE YOU LIVE.
        <br>
        EU PRIVACY LAW REQUIRES US TO BE SPECIFIC ABOUT OUR REASONS AND LEGAL GROUNDS FOR USING YOUR PERSONAL DATA. ACCORDINGLY, FOR THE PURPOSES OF EU PRIVACY LAW ONLY, THE INFORMATION BELOW DESCRIBES THE TYPES OF DATA WE PROCESS, WHERE WE GET YOUR DATA FROM, THE GROUNDS WE RELY ON TO CARRY OUT THE PROCESSING, AND WHO WE MAY SHARE YOUR DATA WITH. EXCEPT FOR THE “PROCESSED DATA CATEGORIES” SECTIONS SET OUT IN THE INFORMATION BELOW, NOTHING IS INTENDED TO BIND US IN RESPECT OF OUR NON-EU USERS.<br>
        <br>
        Country-specific provisions <br>
        Please note that there may be local variations to this Privacy Policy in order to comply with local legislation.
        <br>
        In particular, there may be local deviations within the European Union in which case, please talk to your hotel’s front desk manager for more information or contact us at dataprotection@radissonhotels.com. If you have questions about an individual hotel’s practices or the information provided by it, please contact the hotel directly.
